 ## Methodes:
 
 - totalSupply: A method that defines the total supply of your tokens.
 - balanceOf: A method that returns the number of tokens a wallet address has.
 - transfer: A method that takes a certain amount of tokens from the total supply (owner address) and gives it to a user.
 - approve: What approve does is to allow an owner to approve a delegate account to withdraw tokens from his account and to transfer them to other accounts.
 - allowance: This method is exactly the same as the approved method except that it checks if one user has enough balance to send a certain amount of tokens to another.
 - transferFrom: Another type of transfer method which is used to transfer tokens between users. It is necessary to make first the approve function to allow someone to transfer tokens.
